I engineer software and write bugs. Some of the things I'm working on:

- Numerical methods
- Competitive programming
- Scientific programming
- Systems programming
- CUDA
- Fluid dynamics
- My never ending [NixOs Config](https://github.com/xbazzi/nixos-config)

TODO:

- FOSS contribution
- Socket programming
- Design Patterns
- ~~Learn functional programming~~ Nix (kinda counts)
- Fiddle with the Opens:
    - OpenMP
    - OpenCV
    - OpenGL
    - OpenFOAM
- Touch grass (not required)
